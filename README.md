# triton_runner

triton_runner(Triton multi-level runner) is a lightweight, multi-level execution engine for [Triton](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton), designed to support IR/PTX/cubin launches in complex pass pipelines.

triton_runner is compatible with **Triton v3.3.x (primary), v3.4.0, or v3.2.0**, and may not work with other versions.

## Example

> **Note:** The following example requires an NVIDIA GPU with compute capability `sm90 (H100, H200, H20, etc.)`, `sm80 (A100, A30)`, `sm120 (RTX PRO 6000, RTX 5090, etc.)`, `sm86 (A10, RTX 3090, etc.)` or `sm75 (T4, RTX 2080, etc.)`. Please make sure to install the package before running the example.

> If your GPU does not have one of the above compute capabilities, you can use `TRITON_CACHE_DIR=$PWD/.cache` to output the Triton cache to the current directory, and then copy the corresponding cache files to your target machine.

Here's an example command that targets sm90 with Triton v3.3.x. For more target, please refer to [examples](./doc/examples.md). If your Triton version is v3.4.0, please refer to [examples_v3.4.0](./doc/examples_v3.4.0.md) for example commands. If your Triton version is v3.2.0, please refer to [examples_v3.2.0](./doc/examples_v3.2.0.md) for example commands.
